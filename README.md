# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard for analyzing road traffic accidents in the UK (2021–2022).
The dashboard visualizes accident severity, weather effects, speed limits, vehicle types, light conditions, road surfaces, and time-based patterns.

## Project Overview

Road accidents remain a critical public safety concern. Accident severity is influenced by factors such as:

Weather conditions

Speed limits

Road surface conditions

Light conditions

Time of day

Urban vs rural areas

The goal of this project is to transform raw accident data into a clear, visually interactive Excel dashboard to support data-driven safety policies and decision-making.

## Project Workflow

These slicers allow users to explore specific patterns and peak accident periods.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:

Accident severity

Date, time, and day of week

Light, weather, & road surface conditions

Urban vs rural

Speed limits

Vehicle types

Number of casualties

Number of vehicles

Junction details

Local authority & geographic location

## Key Insights from Analysis

Peak accident time: around 5 PM

Speed limit with highest accidents: 30mph zones

Wet roads contribute heavily to accidents

Urban areas account for most accidents

Daylight and darkness-lighted conditions dominate accident timing

## Data-Driven Recommendations

Increase patrol presence and awareness campaigns during peak hours (4:30–6 PM)

Introduce speed bumps & better junction controls in 30mph zones

Improve drainage systems and install warning signs in wet-prone areas

Enhance night visibility infrastructure

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Pivot tables & charts

Conditional formatting

Custom-designed dashboard layout

Interactive slicers and filters

##  How to Use the Dashboard
